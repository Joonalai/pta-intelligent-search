# PTA Intelligent Search

This code provides an intelligent search for the Finnish Geospatial Platform. The codebase provides the following components:

* **harvester**: a command line tool to harvest metadata records from a CSW and index them into an elasticsearch instance
* **api**: REST based search API (spring boot web)

Libraries
* **document-processor**: A library to extract information from XML and transform it
* **elasticsearch**: contains named constants used both by the harvester and API
* **metadata-annotation**: document processor components that does automatic annotation (using maui) as well as matches words to ontologies using stemmers. These are used to index textual content as well-defined terms in the used ontology 
* **metadata-extractor**: document processor configuration for extracting data from CSW metadata responses
* **qa**: project for end-to-end elasticsearch tests (not done yet)


## Installation for development

### 1. Start elasticsearch

For the system to work, you need to run elasticsearch in localhost port 9200. The easiest way to do this is to use docker. To create and start the container run:

`docker run -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e "discovery.type=single-node" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-oss:6.2.4`

If you stop this container (or reboot your computer), you no longer need to create a new container. Instead you can just start it via `docker start [container id]`

### 2. Harvesting data

To populate elasticsearch with data, you must first ensure that the index is set up correctly. 

```
cd /where/you/cloned/pta-intelligent-search/elasticsearch-script
./metaindex.sh
```

If you need to modify the index, you will probably need to first remove the old index via `./metaclean.sh` and then create the index via `./metaindex.sh`. This directory also contains some other handy scripts.

Once the index is set up, run the harvester class in pta-intelligent-search-harvester: `fi.maanmittauslaitos.pta.search.Harvester`. Usually the easiest way to do this is to run the class in an IDE where you have the all the projects.

This process harvests all records from the Finnish National Catalogue (paikkatietohakemisto.fi) and exits once done.

### 3. Run the search API

Run the class `fi.maanmittauslaitos.pta.search.api.Application` from the project pta-intelligent-search-api. Usually the easiest way to do this is to run the class in an IDE where you have the all the projects.
